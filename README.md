# Repurpose resources conttentype plugin #

Create interactive content from existing Moodle activities by importing
media files and questions from the Moodle questiom bank into the content
bank as basic H5P content types.

Currently this plugin supports four basic Moodle question types: Essay,
Multiple Choice, Short Answer, and True/False.  They can be imported
individually as Essay, Multiple Choice, Guess the Answer, and True/False
H5P content types. Questions in a directory can be imported collectively
to create a Column, Crossword, Single Choice Set, Dialog Cards or Flash Cards
content types. Audio, video, and image files can also be imported into
the column content type. After creation the content types can be edited
in the content bank as normal H5P content and combined with other content
through copy and paste.

After installation, teachers may create interactive content in the content
bank by navigating to a course which has the Moodle questions to use,
clicking the _Add_ button and then choosing one of the _Repurpose resources_
content types from the drop down menu, to open the editor, and selecting questions
and other options in the editor and saving. The new content created from
the question will now appear inside the content bank.
